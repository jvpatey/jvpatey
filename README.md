# 👋 Hi, I'm Jeff Patey (@jvpatey)

- 🎓 I've completed the Get Building Software Development Program in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
- 💻 I'm a full-stack developer passionate about building responsive, user-focused applications.
- ✨ I'm committed to continuous learning and excited to grow through hands-on projects and new technologies.

## Projects

### 🚧 Currently Building
- 🌟 [**Aura**](https://github.com/ThinkRad/Aura) – A writing app being developed in collaboration with ThinkRad, built with SwiftUI and Xcode. This iOS mobile application will be available on the App Store in the near future.  
- 📱 [**HomeKeep Mobile**](https://github.com/jvpatey/homekeep-mobile) – A fully native mobile version of HomeKeep, built with React Native (Expo + TypeScript) and Supabase. It helps users manage and track recurring home maintenance tasks with notifications, stats, and a clean, accessible design — now available on the [**App Store**](https://homekeep-website.vercel.app). I'm continually adding new features and improvements.  

### 📂 Previous Projects
- 🏠 [**HomeKeep**](https://github.com/jvpatey/HomeKeep) – A home maintenance notification web app utilizing Firebase and Firestore for storage, authentication, notifications, and backend-like functionality.  
- 🦷 [**OralCheckr**](https://github.com/jvpatey/OralCheckr) – A full-stack oral health assessment and habit tracker app built with React (frontend) and Express (backend).  

### 🗂️ Backlog
- 🚀 [**StreamLn**](https://github.com/jvpatey/StreamLn) – An all-in-one workspace for dev notes, tasks, and clarity — inspired by Notion, Trello, and Slack Canvas, and designed specifically for developers. It's a longer-term project I plan to revisit as I continue expanding HomeKeep.
