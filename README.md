# 👋 Hi, I'm Jeff Patey (@jvpatey)

- 🎓 I've completed the Get Building Software Development Program in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
- 💻 I'm a full-stack developer passionate about building responsive, user-focused applications.
- ✨ I'm committed to continuous learning and excited to grow through hands-on projects and new technologies.

## Projects

### 📂 Previous Projects
- 🏠 [**HomeKeep**](https://github.com/jvpatey/HomeKeep) – A home maintenance notification web app utilizing Firebase and Firestore for storage, authentication, notifications, and backend-like functionality.
- 🦷 [**OralCheckr**](https://github.com/jvpatey/OralCheckr) – A full-stack oral health assessment and habit tracker app built with React (frontend) and Express (backend).
- 📱 [**HomeKeep Mobile**](https://github.com/jvpatey/homekeep-mobile) – I reimagined a previous project - HomeKeep, as a fully native mobile experience. Built with React Native (Expo + TypeScript) and Supabase, it helps users manage and track recurring home maintenance tasks with notifications, stats, and a clean, accessible design — now available on the [**App Store**](homekeep-website.vercel.app)

### 🚧 Currently Building
- 🚀 [**StreamLn**](https://github.com/jvpatey/StreamLn) – An all-in-one workspace for dev notes, tasks, and clarity, built for developers who think in tasks, code, and connected ideas. Inspired by Notion, Trello, and Slack Canvas — but designed specifically for developers.
